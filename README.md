# Breadcrumb File-Browser

This is a solution to a short pre-interview question, which is required to write a breadcrumb file-browser component in react.

The solution is done using `React`, `React-Router` and `Bulma` for frontend. The server is implemented using `ExpressJs`.

For the sake of simplicity, it assumes the file structure starts with `root`. Furthermore, when a path, which does not exist, is requested, the server will reponse 404, and the client will immediately redirect to `root`.

To edit the file structure for testing, you need to update the content of the object `root` located inside `src/server.js`.

To test the app, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

This will run the server at port `5000` and the frontend at port `3000`.

The `nodemon` package and `react-script` enable auto-reload to develop and test the solution quickly.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
